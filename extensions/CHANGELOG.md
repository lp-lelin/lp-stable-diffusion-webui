## Changelog
### 0.4.4
 * Compatibility with stable-diffusion-webui 1.6.0
### 0.4.3 video processing tab
 * Added an option to process videos directly from a video file. This leads to better results than batch-processing individual frames of a video. Allows generating depthmap videos, that can be used in further generations as custom depthmap videos.
 * UI improvements.
 * Extra stereoimage generation modes - enable in extension settings if you want to use them.
 * New stereoimage generation parameter - offset exponent. Setting it to 1 may produce more realistic outputs.
### 0.4.2
 * Added UI options for 2 additional rembg models.
 * Heatmap generation UI option is hidden - if you want to use it, please activate it in the extension settings.
 * Bugfixes.
### 0.4.1 standalone mode
 * Added ability to run DepthMap without WebUI. (Use main.py. Make sure all the dependencies are installed. The support is not feature-complete.)
 * NormalMap generation
### 0.4.0 large code refactor
 * UI improvements
 * Improved Batch from Directory, Clip and renormalize DepthMap
 * Slightly changed the behaviour of various options
 * Extension may partially work even if some of the dependencies are unmet

### 0.3.12
 * Fixed stereo image generation
 * Other bugfixes
### 0.3.11
 * 3D model viewer (Experimental!)
 * simple and fast (occluded) 3D mesh generation, support for equirectangular projection
      (accurate results with ZoeDepth models only, no boost, no custom maps)
 * default output format is now obj for inpainted mesh and simple mesh
### 0.3.10 
 * ZoeDepth support (with boost), 3 new models, best results so far
 * better heatmap
### 0.3.9

 * setting to flip Left/Right SBS images
 * added missing parameter for 3d inpainting (repeat_inpaint_edge)
 * option to generate demo videos with mesh
### 0.3.6 new feature
 * implemented binary ply file format for the inpainted 3D mesh, big reduction in filesize and save/load times. 
 * added progress indicators to the inpainting process 
### 0.3.5 bugfix
 * create path to 3dphoto models before download (see [issue](https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script/issues/76))
### 0.3.4 new featues
 * depth clipping option (original idea by [@Extraltodeus](https://github.com/Extraltodeus))
 * by popular demand, 3D-Photo-Inpainting is now implemented
 * generate inpainted 3D mesh (PLY) and videos of said mesh 
### 0.3.3 bugfix and new midas models
 * updated to midas 3.1, bringing 2 new depth models (the 512 one eats VRAM for breakfast!)
 * fix Next-ViT dependency issue for new installs
 * extension no longer clones repositories, all dependencies are now contained in the extension
### 0.3.2 new feature and bugfixes
 * several bug fixes for apple silicon and other machines without cuda
 * NEW Stereo Image Generation techniques for gap filling by [@semjon00](https://github.com/semjon00) using polylines. (See [here](https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script/pull/56)) Significant improvement in quality.
### 0.3.1 bugfix
 * small speed increase for anaglyph creation
 * clone midas repo before midas 3.1 to fix issue (see [here](https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script/issues/55#issue-1510266008))
### 0.3.0 improved stereo image generation
 * New improved technique for generating stereo images and balancing distortion between eyes by [@semjon00](https://github.com/semjon00) (See [here](https://github.com/thygate/stable-diffusion-webui-depthmap-script/pull/51))
 * Substantial speedup of stereo image generation code using numba JIT
### 0.2.9 new feature 
 * 3D Stereo (side-by-side) and red/cyan anaglyph image generation.
